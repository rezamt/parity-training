## Practicing different Consensus Engines and Chain using Parity
Engines are devided into two main categories in accordance to Proof of Works (PoW) and Proof of Authority (PoA) 

### Proof of Work Engines - Public Networks
- [ ] Ethash
- [ ] Instant Seal

### Proof of Authority using Validator engines (a.k.a Authority Servers) - Private and Consortium based BlockChain Networks
- [ ] Aura / [Authority Round](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/6190)
- [ ] Tendermint
